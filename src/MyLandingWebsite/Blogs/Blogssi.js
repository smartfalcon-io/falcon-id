In this section, we'll unravel the implications of decentralized governance and its alignment with the principles of Web3.",

Instead of relying on centralized authorities to manage and control identity information, individuals are empowered with control over their own digital identities. The use of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) ensures a secure and unique representation in the digital space, offering a stark contrast to the vulnerabilities of centralized identity management."

Issuers are entities that create and issue verifiable credentials, while Verifiers are entities that request and verify these credentials during transactions. The decentralized nature of this model ensures a more secure and adaptable identity ecosystem, as opposed to relying on a single entity for both issuance and verification."
